> *Use this checklist for 10 tips to help make that paper perfect.*

# 1. Know the Assignment

Rule #1 – make sure you are following the assignment. Make sure you understand the requirements and expectations. How long should the paper be? Do you need to include specific sources? Do you have free range of topic, or is there a specific prompt?

# 2. Start With A Good Argument
What are you writing about? What is this paper trying to prove or show? Don’t just type every thought in your head in pursuit of that 2000 word count. Your paper should present a thoughtful, well articulated argument that reaches a nuanced conclusion.

# 3. Then Back It Up – Support Your Argument
Having a strong thesis statement is fundamental for any good paper. How do you prove your point of view? With evidence! Source and source and cite some more. Primary sources should focus on academic sources (research journals, newspapers, books etc). Secondary sources can be more diverse (magazines, interviews etc.). Obviously the types of sources needed will depend on the paper and the assignment. Some Professors require a minimum number of sources. Make sure you’re always following your writing prompt.

# 4. Proofread & Proofread Again
TYPOS ARE DEATH. Poor spelling and grammar mistakes can majorly hurt your final grade. And never rely on or trust autocorrect or spelling checkers to pick up on everything.

*“The principle point of this paper is to explore the affects of whether on gorilla warfare in Asian.”*

All of the above is spelled correctly, and yet totally wrong. Don’t let this happen to you.

# 5. Say It In Your Own Words – Don’t Plagiarize
This should go without saying – but don’t be a copycat. Plagiarism is a violation of every school’s academic code. Use your own voice and words when you write. With the amount of resources online it can be tempting to just copy & paste. But do the work and never steal from other sources. Many schools have plagiarism checking software that will catch plagiarism. It is not worth it.

# 6. Avoid Words You Don’t Know
Expanding your vocabulary is laudable (see what I did there?) but if you don’t really understand the word or phrase don’t use it in your paper. Don’t feel the need to pepper your paper with your old SAT vocab words. If you use a word incorrectly, it discredits your argument – and professors can see right through it.

# 7. Don’t Use These Words
First, second, and third are transitions that should be used sparingly and interspersed within paragraphs, rather than to initiate every paragraph. Sure, it’s okay to say, “First, Melvin learned to chill through the healing powers of hot yoga.” Beyond that, enumerating all of your points is a little basic and overused.

Avoid meaningless filler words. Additionally, accurately, factually, and simultaneously are not useful in forming or proving an argument. Removing instances of verbosity will make your language sound cleaner and more sophisticated.

# 8. Write & Revise
Congrats, you finished a first draft. Now the hard work starts. And in some sparkle. Make sure you read through the paper aloud to yourself. This will help you catch major errors but also help you review your argument. PRO-TIP you can also copy & paste your paper into Google translate & have it read back to you. Hearing your paper read aloud can give you a new perspective, and will help with editing.

# 9. Get Feedback – Don’t Be Afraid to Get Help
Every get writer has a great editor. Whether that is someone to help proofread and check for mistakes, or just someone to help guide you to a better laid out argument. Use all the resources available to you. There’s no shame in getting academic help, and it’s always good to have someone look over your work before you turn it in.

# 10. In Conclusion
Make sure your paper leaves a good impression. The conclusion of your paper should be your mic drop. This is your chance to summarize your argument & convince your reader. So make it count.
